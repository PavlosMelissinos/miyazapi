A collection of functions to help me navigate trakt.tv and discover new movies
to watch.

Check out `miyazapi.repl` for examples/instructions

- To be used in a REPL (for now).
- You might want to create a trakt app to limit the amount of throttling
  trakt.tv does (I need to test where it does make a difference).
- Open to requests but I'll give priority to features I'm also interested in.
- Definitely in alpha state, very experimental and the API is extremely likely
  to change.
- Tests to be added in time.
